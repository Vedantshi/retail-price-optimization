# Retail Price Optimization and Margin Intelligence System

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end framework for data-driven retail price optimization. It integrates machine learning models, competitor price intelligence, and freight cost analysis to help businesses make smarter pricing decisions that maximize profit, not just revenue.

Using Python for modeling and Tableau for visualization, this project supports pricing strategy, category management, and executive-level decision-making with actionable insights and scenario simulations.

## üîç Problem Statement

Retailers often set prices based on instinct, not insight ‚Äî missing how competitor moves, price sensitivity, or freight costs affect the bottom line. This project builds a system that:

- Models demand based on price and competition  
- Analyzes profit-impacting freight cost ratios  
- Simulates the impact of price changes across categories  
- Provides interactive tools for stakeholder-driven decision making
